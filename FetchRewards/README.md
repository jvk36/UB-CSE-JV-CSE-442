Coding Exercise for Fetch Rewards Internship Application

About

The assignment is an android app to show item details grouped by item id and then by name. The app pulls data from https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json.

Running the App

To run the app, do the following: a) get the code from GitHub and open the folder in Android Studio as a project, and b) configure an emulator or use a physical Android device to run the project on. To use a physical Android device, plug your phone into the computer. Then copy the run-image on to the device.

The app displays a scrollable page consisting of the 3 columns “List Id”, “Name” and “Id” sorted first by ListId and then by Name. Note: remember to sync the project with gradle files when opening the project in Android Studio the first time after getting the code from GitHub.
